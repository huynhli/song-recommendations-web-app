# similarSongs

Have you ever noticed that after listening to Spotify for a while, you get recommended the same songs every time? Whether it be albums, artists, songs, or playlists, Spotify uses [collaborative filtering](https://www.techaheadcorp.com/blog/spotify-recommendation-system/#:~:text=Instead%20of%20just%20individual%20user,deeper%20understanding%20of%20user%20preferences.) to recommend songs to users. This is summarized as Spotify looking for users who like the same songs as you, 
and recommending songs that *they* like. This *can* be great, but it can also lead to you hearing the exact same song every time you finish an album or playlist. So, that led me to making this.

lmk if a social aspect would be cool. otherwise i will leave as is
