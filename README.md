# go-react-web
 The back and frontend for a song recommendation website using spotify API, golang, and react. Also other things such as tailwind, node.js, etc.

First thing I did was create the react app with vite, choosing to write in typescript + swc.
Then, I created the go backend directory as well as the go.mod file based on my previous project https://github.com/huynhli/golang-learning.
