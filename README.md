Have you ever noticed that after listening to Spotify for a while, you get recommended the same songs every time? Whether it be albums, artists, songs, or playlists, Spotify uses [collaborative filtering](https://www.techaheadcorp.com/blog/spotify-recommendation-system/#:~:text=Instead%20of%20just%20individual%20user,deeper%20understanding%20of%20user%20preferences.) to recommend songs to users. This is summarized as Spotify looking for users who like the same songs as you, 
and recommending songs that *they* like. This can be great, but it can also be repetitive. So, my project looks to use Spotify's recommendation 
algorithm but without the user-based side of it, utilizing Spotify's Web API.

The back and frontend for this song recommendation website uses Spotify Web API, and more coming soon --> (Last.fm API, MusicBrainz/AcousticBrainz, Discogs API, and Deezer API).

Thanks for checking out my project! Check out my Github profile if you'd like to see more things like this in the future!
